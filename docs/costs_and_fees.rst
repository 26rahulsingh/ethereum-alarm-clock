Call pricing and fees
=====================

The Alarm service operates under a **scheduler pays** model, which means that
the scheduler of a call is responsible for paying for the full gas cost and
fees associated with executing the call.

This payment is automatic and happens during the course of the execution of the scheduled call.

Minimum Balance
---------------

In order to guarantee reimbursment of gas costs and payment to the account which executes the scheduled call, the scheduler of the call must have an account balance sufficient to pay for the call at the time of execution.
