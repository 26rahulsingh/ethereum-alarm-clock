Welcome to Ethereum Alarm Clock's documentation!
================================================

The Ethereum Alarm Clock is a service that allows scheduling of contract
function calls at a specified block number in the future.  These scheduled
calls are executed by other nodes on the ethereum network in exchange for a
small payment and reimbursment of gas costs.

The service is completely trustless, open source, and verifiable.
